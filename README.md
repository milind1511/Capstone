# BookMyShow Clone (MERN)

This repository contains a clone of the BookMyShow cinema ticket booking platform, built as a capstone project for a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science.

## Project Overview

Users can browse movies by city and theater, view showtimes, select seats, and purchase tickets. The application consists of:

- A React frontend to handle UI and user interactions
- An Express/Node.js backend to manage APIs and business logic
- MongoDB for data persistence (movies, theaters, users, bookings)

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the `/server` and `/client` folders to install dependencies and run the application.
